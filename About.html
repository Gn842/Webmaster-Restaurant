    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Where is our food from: Our restaurant works with local farms and farmers, such as:</p>
    <ul style="padding: 0px 400px 0px 400px;">
        <li>Tiger Farms (farm)</li>
        <li>Swamp View Acres (farm)</li>
        <li>Lysco Corp. (distributor)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where we get our vegetables, milk and cheese from.<br><br>
         - We get our variety of cheeses from Germany<br><br>
         - We get our wheat products from within the US<br><br>
         - We get our (most) toppings from local farms<br><br>
         - We make our lemonade in house and outsource other drinks(soda).</p>
    <p>Where do we get our food from?<br><br>
         - Partnering with local farms, we strive to get most of our vegetables, fruits, and dairy products from there, making sure your food is as fresh and healthy for you as possible.</p>
    <p>How is it prepared?<br><br>
         - Wheat is provided by local farmers- then turned into dough. tomatoes are mashed into sauce organically. Toppings are provided from farms. Milk from local cows is turned into cheese.</p>
    <p>Environmental impact:<br><br>
        - We support local bio systems by using the sources provided near us. Buying ingredients from far away places is bad for the environment due to emissions being released.<br><br><br>
        Outsourced: more “exotic” ingredients like cocoa powder<br><br>
        Our team: everyone has a different role. ex: head cook, server, manager, <br><br></p>
    <p>Social responsibility:<br><br>
        - Economic viability (sustainability): buying from local farms reduces “food miles”/materials and money used to get ingredients.</p>
